## How to use

Follow the instructions below to get the modpack launcher. When ran, it will provide you with a GUI to manage installation.

- ### Windows

  Right-click on the link below, click `Save link as...`, then save the file:

  > ### [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OOClan/AllTheClan/master/AllTheClan-Launcher.bat)

- ### Linux and macOS

  If running Linux, make sure you have Qt5 installed. Refer to the MultiMC [installation instructions](https://multimc.org/).

  Open a `Terminal` window, then type in:

  ```bash
  cd ~ && \
    curl -sL "https://git.io/Jk2sv" -o "AllTheClan-Launcher.sh" && \
    chmod +x "AllTheClan-Launcher.sh" && \
    "./AllTheClan-Launcher.sh"
  ```

  The launcher will be saved in your profile directory.

To play the game, _always_ use this launcher, not just the first time - it performs important setup.
